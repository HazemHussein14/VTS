## **Overview**

### **Domain Problem**

Historically, vacation time approvals required a manager's authorization followed by validation from an HR clerk, resulting in a manual process that often took several days.

### **Vision**

The Vacation Tracking System (VTS) empowers employees to manage their own vacation time, sick leave, and personal time off in alignment with company and facility-specific policies.

**Key Objectives:**

- Streamline HR department processes by reducing manual intervention.
- Minimize non-core business-related management tasks.
- Foster employee empowerment by giving them control over their leave management.

1. **Rules-Based Leave Validation:**  
   Implement a flexible rules engine for validating and verifying leave requests.

2. **Managerial Oversight:**

3. **Comprehensive Leave History:**

   - Provide access to requests from the past calendar year.
   - Support future requests up to 18 months ahead.

4. **Email Notifications:**  
   Use email to:

   - Request manager approvals.
   - Notify employees of request status changes.

5. **Infrastructure Integration:**

   - Leverage existing hardware and middleware.
   - Integrate with the companyâ€™s intranet portal, utilizing single-sign-on (SSO) for authentication.

6. **Transaction Logging:**  
   Log all system transactions for auditing purposes.

7. **Administrative Overrides:**  
   Enable HR and system administrators to override actions, with detailed logging for transparency.

8. **Managerial Granting:**  
   Allow managers to directly award personal leave time, adhering to system-set limits.

9. **Web Service Interface:**  
   Provide APIs to query an employee's vacation request summary.

10. **Legacy System Integration:**  
    Interface with HR legacy systems to fetch employee information and updates.
